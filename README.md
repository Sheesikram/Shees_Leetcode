# LeetCode Solutions in Python

Welcome to the **LeetCode Solutions in Python** repository! This collection contains solutions to various LeetCode problems, written in Python. Each solution is designed to be clean, efficient, and easy to understand. The repository is regularly updated with new solutions as more problems are solved.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Solutions to problems from a wide range of categories, including:
  - Arrays
  - Strings
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Trees & Graphs
  - Linked Lists
  - Backtracking and more.
  
- **Optimized Code:** Focus on writing Pythonic and optimized code with explanations and multiple approaches (where applicable).

- **Well-Documented:** Each solution contains comments and explanations to clarify the approach, logic, and time/space complexity.

- **Continuous Updates:** This repository will be updated frequently as new problems are solved or improved solutions are discovered.

## How to Use
You can browse the repository and explore the solutions folder to find a solution for a particular problem. Each file is named after the problem, with LeetCode's problem number for easy reference.

### Example:
If you want to look up the solution for "Two Sum" (LeetCode Problem #1):
```bash
1_two_sum.py
```

## Prerequisites
To run the Python solutions locally, you will need Python installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leetcode-python-solutions.git
   cd leetcode-python-solutions
   ```

2. Install any dependencies if required (though most solutions will only use Python's standard library).

3. Run the Python files directly using:
   ```bash
   python problem_filename.py
   ```
